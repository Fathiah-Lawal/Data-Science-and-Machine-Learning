# Kaggle Work

This file contains my Kaggle practice work as I continue learning data science and machine learning. I use Kaggle notebooks to experiment with datasets, compare models, and improve my understanding of analysis and prediction techniques.

## Bike Demand Model Comparison

A beginner-level project where I compare multiple machine learning models to predict bike rental demand.
The notebook covers basic data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation.

More Kaggle notebooks will be added as I complete them.
