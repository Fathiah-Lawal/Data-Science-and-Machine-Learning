# Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning
This repository contains my learning projects, experiments, and practice notebooks as I continue to grow in data science and machine learning. The goal of this repo is to document my progress, track what I am learning, and build a collection of projects that show my understanding of real-world data analysis and predictive modelling. The goal is to document my progress, build structured projects, and improve my knowledge of real-world data workflows.

## Objectives

* Learn and apply core data science concepts
* Build and improve end-to-end machine learning projects
* Practice data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and model evaluation
* Compare algorithms and understand their behaviors
* Track growth in a structured and organized way

## Repository Structure
**data:** Raw and processed datasets
**notebooks:** Analysis, preprocessing, and modelling notebooks
**scripts:** Python scripts for reusable functions
**models:** Saved trained models
**visuals:** Plots and charts created during analysis
**docs:** Additional notes, reports, or explanations

## Current Stage
I am currently learning and practicing:
* Data exploration and preprocessing
* Supervised learning
* Model comparison
* Performance metrics
* Basic feature engineering
More advanced concepts will be added later.

## Technologies Used

Python
Pandas
NumPy
scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook



If you want, I can also create a **more stylish GitHub profile README**, or a **project-specific README** for your bike demand notebook.
