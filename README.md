# Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning
This repository contains my learning projects, experiments, and practice notebooks as I continue to grow in data science and machine learning. The goal of this repo is to document my progress, track what I am learning, and build a collection of projects that show my understanding of real-world data analysis and predictive modelling.
